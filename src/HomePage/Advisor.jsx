          Depend on JMJ Retirement to mitigate fiduciary risks associated with
          the selection, oversight, and administration of plan investments. As a
          3(21) and 3(38) fiduciary, we shoulder the responsibility of
          meticulously researching, choosing, and supervising funds, making
          adjustments as needed to refine your planâ€™s portfolio. We distinguish
          our comprehensive fiduciary services from those of non-fiduciary
          brokers or salespeople, ensuring you receive dedicated expertise and
          support. We go above and beyond most advisors by actually assisting
          with the compliance test and taking as much of that process off your
          hands.
